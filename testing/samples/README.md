# Notes

- `./add_data_sh` - a script that populates OpenSearch indexes with data
  given to us by UI team (Jeremy?). We do not use or run it!
- `./data.json` - content of `add_data.sh` transformed it into a proper JSON
  file of Open Search documents.
- `./soa.json` - the Indexer Spec which is supposed to generate docs of `/data.json`.
